# Introduction to statistical learning and applications 2024

Hi :wave: 

This is the main page to look for details of our classes on "Introduction to 
statistical learning and applications" in 2024. Please note that we **won't be using Chamilo**, 
so you should be checking this page regularly for updates.

### Instructors

  - CM10: Introduction to network analysis
  - TP4: Graph mining and community detection

- **Week 11 (29-April 2023)**

  - TP4: Graph mining and community detection

### Textbooks
- Our course has an official booklet available [here](https://cloud.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/s/iTtXPTdLpyMwBtN).
    - **Important**: Please note that although this is the “official” booklet, the materials covered in class are not entirely included in it. Also, I won’t be presenting everything that is written in the booklet. Conclusion: to be sure of what I’ve given in class, you should always come to classes! (and take a look at the slides)
- Many examples and explanations given in class were inspired (or unashamedly copied) from Cosma Shalizi’s excellent lecture notes *“The truth about linear regression”* available [here](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/TALR/).
- Students should also consider reading some chapters from James et al. (2022) *"Introduction to statistical learning with applications to R"* which is freely (and legally) available [here](https://www.statlearning.com/).
- Another excellent reference is Hastie et al. (2017) *"Elements of Statistical Learning"* which is freely (and legally) available [here](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/).

### Grading

### About the TP reports
The average of the reports for all four TPs count as **half of your final grade**, 
so be sure to do them properly and nicely. The reports (both `rmd` and `html` files) 
should be delivered on [Teide](https://teide.ensimag.fr/). If no one in your team has access to it, then you 
can send your report by e-mail to me or Alexandre, depending on which TP group you are in.
